## Part I — Foundations

### Chapter 1 — What this package does and why it matters

- 1.1 The problem: choosing where to run experiments
- 1.2 Optimality criteria — what they measure and why it matters
  - **I-optimality**: minimising average prediction variance across the design region; the right choice when you want reliable predictions anywhere in the factor space
  - **D-optimality**: maximising the determinant of the information matrix; the right choice when you care most about precise coefficient estimates
  - **A-optimality**: minimising the trace of the inverse information matrix; distributes estimation variance evenly across all coefficients
  - When the three criteria disagree, and how much it usually matters in practice
- 1.3 Power assurance — what it means to "guarantee" power
  - Statistical power defined: the probability of detecting an effect that is real
  - Why design and power are coupled: the same design determines both prediction quality and test sensitivity
  - How the package searches: the binary search over `n`, the inner Fedorov exchange, and the outer multi-start
- 1.4 The four power modes at a glance
  - Linear contrast (F-test on Lβ = δ)
  - Global R² (omnibus F-test)
  - GLM Wald χ² (binomial / Poisson)
  - Multi-response (per-response + combination rule)
- 1.5 The six interfaces at a glance — a map for new users
  - Python API, CLI, Streamlit, Excel, Google Sheets, Jupyter Widgets, REST API
  - "Which interface should I use?" decision guide

## Part II — Power Modes

*Each chapter in this part covers one power mode: the statistical concept, the configuration class, and a realistic end-to-end example. Examples build in complexity from chapter to chapter.*

---

### Chapter 3 — Linear contrasts: detecting a specific effect

**Running example:** A polymer chemistry lab is testing whether reaction temperature (continuous, 150–250 °C) and catalyst type (categorical: A / B / C) affect yield. The team wants 80% power to detect a 0.5 standard-deviation shift in yield attributable to temperature.

- 3.1 What a contrast is: L, δ, and the F-test for Lβ = δ
  - The model matrix X and its columns
  - The contrast matrix L: selecting one coefficient, combining several, or comparing treatment groups
  - δ: the minimum effect size worth detecting, in response units / σ
  - The noncentrality parameter λ = δᵀ [L(X'X)⁻¹Lᵀ]⁺ δ / σ² and where it comes from
- 3.2 Setting up `PowerContrastConfig`
  - Counting model-matrix columns from a Patsy formula (the most common source of confusion)
  - Constructing L manually for a single main-effect contrast
  - Setting δ, α, power, σ, and max_n
- 3.3 `contrast_from_scenarios`: building L and δ from two experimental scenarios
  - When to use scenarios vs. manual L
  - The `sesoi` parameter (smallest effect of interest) and its units
- 3.4 Running `i_optimal_powered_design` and reading the result
  - `design_df`: the run table
  - `buckets_df`: unique run allocations with counts
  - `report`: achieved power, n, noncentrality λ, degrees of freedom, timing
- 3.5 Multi-contrast tests: q > 1 rows in L
  - Joint F-test interpretation
  - Example: testing all treatment contrasts simultaneously
- 3.6 **Full worked example** (Python API, I-optimal, contrast mode, polymer chemistry)
  - Annotated code from formula definition through result interpretation
  - *(This example is also used as the baseline in Chapters 19–21)*

---

### Chapter 4 — Global R²: testing whether the model explains variance

**Running example:** A consumer research team is running a survey study with four continuous predictors and wants to know: is there enough signal in the data to conclude the model is non-trivial? They target R² ≥ 0.15.

- 4.1 What the omnibus F-test measures and when it is the right power target
  - Contrast mode vs. R² mode: when you have a specific effect in mind vs. when you don't
  - Cohen's f²: the effect-size measure underlying R² power calculations
- 4.2 Setting up `PowerR2Config`
  - `r2_target`: the minimum R² worth detecting
  - `lambda_mode`: `"n"` (matches G\*Power / statsmodels) vs. `"n_minus_p"` (more conservative)
  - How `df_num` is derived from the formula (intercept excluded per G\*Power convention)
- 4.3 D-optimality for coefficient estimation: why the criterion choice matters more here
  - When the goal is testing the full model rather than predicting at arbitrary points, D-optimal designs are worth considering
- 4.4 **Full worked example** (Python API, D-optimal, R² mode, consumer survey)
  - Side-by-side comparison of I-optimal and D-optimal designs at the same n and power target
  - Reading `compare_criteria` output to quantify the tradeoff

---

### Chapter 5 — GLM power: binary and count responses

**Running examples:**
- *Binomial*: An e-commerce team is A/B testing a redesigned checkout flow. The baseline conversion rate is 12%. They want 80% power to detect an absolute 3-percentage-point lift.
- *Poisson*: A manufacturing quality team is studying defect counts. The baseline defect rate is 2.4 per batch. They want to detect a 50% reduction driven by process temperature and dwell time.

- 5.1 Why ordinary linear power calculations are wrong for binary and count data
  - The link function, the linear predictor scale, and the response scale
  - Logit link (binomial): effects expressed as log-odds differences
  - Log link (Poisson): effects expressed as log-rate differences
- 5.2 The Fisher-weight approximation used in this package
  - Constant weight w evaluated at the null baseline: w = p₀(1 − p₀) for binomial, w = μ₀ for Poisson
  - Why w cancels from I/D/A criteria (so the design search is structurally identical to OLS)
  - When this approximation is accurate vs. when it degrades: large slopes, wide covariate ranges
- 5.3 Setting up `PowerGLMContrastConfig`
  - `baseline`: probability ∈ (0, 1) for binomial; expected count > 0 for Poisson
  - `family`: `"binomial"` or `"poisson"`
  - `link`: canonical link defaults (logit / log); when to override
  - Expressing δ on the linear-predictor scale (log-odds for binomial; log-rate for Poisson)
  - Using `contrast_from_scenarios` for GLM: what sesoi means on the link scale
- 5.4 **Full worked example — binomial** (Python API + CLI template, e-commerce checkout)
  - Defining scenarios at the response scale and translating to the link scale
  - Generating a starter YAML with `iopt-design --template glm-binomial`
  - Interpreting achieved power and n

  - Multi-factor setup with Poisson count response
  - Validating against a simple simulation (optional sidebar)

---

### Chapter 6 — Multi-response designs: powering several outcomes simultaneously

**Running example:** A chemical process engineer is optimising for three responses at once — yield (continuous, contrast mode), colour score (continuous, contrast mode), and particle size (continuous, R² mode). All three must be adequately powered before the run schedule is approved.

- 6.1 The multi-response problem: why joint power is harder than single-response power
  - Trade-offs: designs that are efficient for one response may be poor for another
  - The design that gets selected is the one that satisfies all responses simultaneously
- 6.2 Combination rules: how per-response power scores are folded into one objective
  - `"min"`: the pessimistic rule — overall power equals the weakest response
  - `"product"`: geometric combination — sensitive to all responses simultaneously
  - `"weighted_mean"`: assign relative importance weights per response; useful when responses have unequal business priority
  - Guidance on which rule to choose
- 6.3 `ResponseSpec` and `MultiResponseOptions`
  - Defining each response: name, formula, factors, power_cfg, weight
  - Setting `sigma_joint` for correlated responses (optional)

  - Use I when prediction quality across the factor space matters (response surface modelling, prediction-focused studies)
  - Use D when coefficient estimation precision is the primary goal (hypothesis-driven studies, mechanistic modelling)
  - Use A when you want balanced precision across all effects and interactions
  - How the three criteria behave differently for categorical-heavy designs vs. continuous designs
- 7.3 `compare_criteria` in practice

## Part VII — Reproducibility, Deployment, and Troubleshooting

### Chapter 23 — Reproducibility

- 23.1 How randomness enters the algorithm
  - Multi-start initialisation uses `random_state`
  - Parallel workers use per-worker seed offsets (`parallel_seed_stride`)
- 23.2 Achieving exact reproducibility
  - `random_state` must be an integer; `None` is not allowed
  - Keep `formula`, `factors`, `starts`, `workers`, and `random_state` fixed across re-runs
  - Store `result["report"]` alongside each output — it records the seed and timing metadata
- 23.3 Cross-machine reproducibility: NumPy version pinning
  - NumPy RNG output can change across major versions; pin `numpy` in `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` for long-lived pipelines
- 23.4 Documenting a design run for regulatory or archival purposes
  - What fields from `report` to capture: `n`, `achieved_power`, `criterion`, `elapsed_sec`, `random_state`, `starts`, `workers`

---

### Chapter 24 — Deployment and scaling

- 24.1 Local deployment options summary
  - Script (Python API), CLI, Streamlit local, Jupyter Widgets
- 24.2 Cloud / server deployment options
  - Streamlit Community Cloud: free, no ops overhead, suitable for teams
  - Docker: portable, reproducible, suitable for IT-managed environments
  - REST API (FastAPI + Uvicorn): suitable for integration into larger platforms
- 24.3 REST API multi-worker deployment
  - `uvicorn api_server.main:create_app --factory --workers 4`
  - Stateless design: each request is independent, safe to distribute across workers
- 24.4 Resource considerations
  - CPU: multi-start parallelism with `workers > N` on a server; multiprocessing guard on macOS / Windows
  - Memory: large candidate sets and high `starts` counts; use `auto_candidate` to avoid over-provisioning
  - Typical run times: single-response contrast at modest n < 1 minute; split-plot or multi-response designs may take several minutes with high `starts`

---

### Chapter 25 — Troubleshooting

- 25.1 `ValueError: power_cfg.max_n must be greater than p`
  - Cause: `max_n` is too small for the formula complexity
  - Fix: increase `max_n` or simplify the formula
- 25.2 No convergence / low achieved power warnings
  - Cause: the search did not find an adequately powered design within `max_n`
  - Fixes: raise `max_n`; increase `starts`; enable `auto_candidate=True`
- 25.3 Parallel `workers > 1` fails on macOS / Windows
  - Cause: `multiprocessing` fork-safety requirement
  - Fix: put all `workers > 1` calls inside `if __name__ == "__main__":`
- 25.4 Contrast matrix shape mismatch errors
  - Cause: L has the wrong number of columns for the formula
  - Diagnosis: `build_model_matrix(formula, factors, pd.DataFrame([...]))` to inspect the column count
- 25.5 GLM baseline out of range
  - Cause: `baseline` ≥ 1 for binomial, or ≤ 0 for either family
  - Fix: pass a probability strictly between 0 and 1 for binomial; a positive count for Poisson
- 25.6 Sheets / Excel authentication or cell-parsing errors
  - Sheets: check `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable and sheet sharing permissions
  - Excel: check file is not open in Excel; ensure `openpyxl` is installed (`[extras]`)
- 25.7 Report generation failures
  - Missing `[report]` or `[report-pdf]` extras
  - PDF: WeasyPrint system-level dependencies (cairo, pango) not installed
